ClangML release HOWTO
=====================

This HOWTO describes how to release a new version of clangml as an official
OPAM[0] package.

I - Tag a new release
---------------------

Please follow the version number of the clang version your are supporting.
For example, all those clangml versions
(3.6.0, 3.6.0.1, 3.6.0.2, 3.6.0.4, 3.6.0.5, 3.6.0.6) support clang-3.6.0.

The official website for the source code of clangml is:
https://github.com/Antique-team/clangml

You must tag this new version of the software:
---
git tag v3.6.0.5 # for example
git push --tags git@github.com:Antique-team/clangml.git
---

Github will automatically create a tarball for this version at:
https://github.com/Antique-team/clangml/archive/v3.6.0.5.tar.gz

II - Create a new OPAM package
------------------------------

Now, you must create a new OPAM package.
For simplicity, we will reuse the already existing package.

---
git clone https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository.git
cd opam-repository
cp -a packages/clangml/clangml.3.6.0.4 packages/clangml/clangml.3.6.0.5
---

Update the URL and MD5 of your new tarball in file
packages/clangml/clangml.3.6.0.5/url.
You must also update the
packages/clangml/clangml.3.6.0.5/opam file since there is
a clang version number in there (external dependencies of the package).

Store the new package version in a specific git branch:
---
git checkout -b clangml_3.6.0.5
git add packages/clangml/clangml.3.6.0.5
git commit packages/clangml/clangml.3.6.0.5
---

Testing the package on Linux and OSX is strongly recommended
(troubleshooting an opam package based on its Travis continuous integration
results being slow and difficult).

Then, create a pull request with your branch at:
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository

Once your pull request is accepted, the new package will be available
to all opam users within a few days (and after they execute 'opam update').
