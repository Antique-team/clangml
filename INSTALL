## Preparations: OCaml shared runtime library
##
#############################################################################


The OCaml Clang interface requires a specially compiled OCaml runtime library
that can be linked as a shared library (plugin). It is not necessary to
recompile all your installed packages with this special compiler.

Note that this is not required on all platforms. Windows and Mac OS X already
compile all code as Position Independent Code and require no special
recompilation of the runtime. On x86, it is also probably not required. On
x86_64, however, it is.


Installation procedure
======================

The following two options are both attempted by the build system, but in case
they fail, you can try them, yourself.


Dependencies
------------

- deriving-ocsigen
- ANSITerminal
- unix
- camlp4.fulllib (Debian package: camlp4-extra)
- apron (for MemCAD)


Using OPAM
----------

First, find out (if you don't know), which compiler you are currently using.
$ CURRENT=`opam switch show`

Next, install the special runtime (compiled with -fPIC, necessary on some
platforms for shared libraries and plugins).
$ opam switch 4.01.0+PIC

Switch back to the preferred compiler.
$ opam switch $CURRENT


Without OPAM
------------

You can download the compiler from
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.01/ocaml-4.01.0.tar.gz and build it
with the following commands:

$ tar zxf ocaml-4.01.0.tar.gz
$ cd ocaml-4.01.0
$ ./configure -prefix $PWD/_install -cc 'gcc -fPIC' -aspp 'gcc -c -fPIC'
$ make world
$ make world.opt
$ make install

Now, typing "make" should just work.
