TODO:
- use clang AST visitor to construct a bridge-AST
- figure out where to put the type/location information
  - in the AST itself?
  - make it queriable through an opaque clang pointer?
- think about location tracking in the presence of heavy transformations

DONE:
- Unit => UnitExpr
- keep track of which ADTs are enums and which are class hierarchies
- make sure enum/constant ADTs are passed and stored by value, not by pointer
