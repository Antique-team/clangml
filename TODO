TODO:
- make it possible to read more than one input source file using the same
  clang process
- add a way to create new clang AST nodes from ocaml AST nodes
- think about location tracking in the presence of heavy transformations
  - we use SourceLocations, so there seems to be nothing we can do
    to create new ones

DONE:
- Unit => UnitExpr
- keep track of which ADTs are enums and which are class hierarchies
- make sure enum/constant ADTs are passed and stored by value, not by pointer
- use clang AST visitor to construct a bridge-AST
- figure out where to put the type/location information
  - in the AST itself?
  - make it queriable through an opaque clang pointer?
  => done: we just use clang SourceLocations
